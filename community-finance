# community finance and business

- when community stalls at socio-economy, decline start..
- if individual aren't growing community isn't growing..
- with individual business community may or may not benefit..
- with community business, community will surely benefit with reinvestement..
- community doesnt grow by catering flow within community, inflow should happen from external community.

# thought
- start business with donation..
- reinvest for new business
- setup SME 
- explore community work model
- explore build operate transfer model
- transparency is key to finance
- community has to give footfall to keep business afloat..
- project has to get footfall from onther community...
- execution has to be topclass for this sustainability. 
- community share losses but community share success
- for footprint, create product for target consumer
